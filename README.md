# xXx NoLimits Profile

This is my xXx NoLimits Profile for my OnePlus 6T
It debloats Oxygen OS to a bare minimum and add some things

## Apps installed extra
- SwiftKey
- Google Clock (because of Spotify intergration)
- Solid Explorer (because all other file managers will be removed)

## Stock Apps replaced
- OxygenOS Dailer + Contacts (replaced with Google Dailer + Contacts)
- OxygenOS Camera (replaced with a modded Google Camera)
